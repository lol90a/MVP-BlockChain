# MVP-BlockChain



This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a blockchain system. It includes essential features such as transaction handling, digital signatures for security, basic smart contract execution using WebAssembly (Wasm), and a simple networking setup using Tokio.

## Features

- **Decentralization**: Peer-to-peer network for handling transactions.
- **Transparency**: Public ledger recording all transactions.
- **Security**: Digital signatures and cryptographic hashing.
- **Scalability**: Framework for handling a large number of transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Execution of smart contracts written in WebAssembly.
